# ProgrammingNotes
A compilation of my notes for learning new programming languages
## Notebook Structure
The notebooks are organized using the supplied tags in each markdown file, as per the specifications of [Notable](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/notable), which I used to take these notes. As such, the file structure may not match the notebook organization, but I will keep the two structures as similar as possible
